	<p> Hi! My name is <u>Kammy Nguyen</u> and I am <em>currently</em> a sophomore at NC State!
	As of right now, I am still undecided, but I plan on majoring in Computer Engineering.
	In my free time, I <strong>enjoy</strong> eating, hanging out with my friends, partying, and sleeping!
	</p>
	<p>When I was in high school, I used to be on the cheer and stunt team!
	Although I do not do cheer at NC State, I still hope to relearn skills I once knew in the past
	</p>
	<p>Over the past summer, I visited my parent's beach house located at Bath, NC!
	We were able to go jetskiing,fishing, and crabbing! I love spending time with my friends and family in my free time!
	</p>
